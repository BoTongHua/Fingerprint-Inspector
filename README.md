# Fingerprint-Inspector
The Fingerprint Inspector is a tool designed to find similarities between altered and real fingerprints and then based on this information trying to find the person to whom this fingerprints belong in the database.

In order to make everything work fine you should take a criminal_record.suspects.json file from database directory and import it to your mongoDB database.
Make sure to name database "criminal_record" and a collection "suspects".
